(Photo by Valerie Chu)</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">Canada goose numbers in Cook County are holding steady — for the past five years, bird watchers have spotted an average of 29 geese a day around the shores of Lake Michigan.</p><p class="paragraph">Yet, despite their prevalence on Northwestern’s Lakefill today, this wasn’t always the case.</p><p class="paragraph">“The crazy thing about Canada geese is that back in the 1950s, people thought that the large, non-migratory Canada goose was extinct,” said John Bates, Curator of Birds at the Field Museum.</p><p class="paragraph">Bates pointed to the research of Harold Hanson, who wrote a book called “The giant Canada goose” where he described how people tried to reestablish Canada geese across the United States.</p><p class="paragraph">“It was a spectacular success from the Canada goose perspective,” Bates said. “So all those non-migratory Canada geese that are here year-round are actually descended from those 100 birds in Rochester, Minnesota in 1950.”</p><p class="paragraph">A prominent ornithological study published in 2019 found that 2.9 billion birds have vanished since 1970. Yet to Bates, looking at the stories of individual bird species also brings him hope that various other species can recover.</p><p class="paragraph">There have been 490 unique bird species spotted in Cook County, according to eBird data. Birdwatchers have recorded bird sightings in practically all corners of the county, with Montrose Point Bird Sanctuary and Northwestern University proving to be particular places of interest.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/27686289" style="width:100%"></div><p class="paragraph">Dr. Eli Suzukovich III, who teaches Northwestern’s Maple Syrup and Climate Change class, said that over the years, he has kept an eye on winter birds and the change in bird species on campus.</p><p class="paragraph">“Right now, when the sap starts flowing, we get goldeneye ducks predominantly, and we get some buffleheads,” Suzukovich said. “And in the last couple of years, students and myself, we&#x27;ve only seen like maybe three pairs, nothing major. If we go back to the 90s and the 80s, you would have had like a couple 100 pairs out in the lake in January or February. These were common Chicago winter ducks.”</p><p class="paragraph">[Insert iNaturalist data here]</p><p class="paragraph">“But the last 10 years since I&#x27;ve been doing maple tapping, the most I&#x27;ve ever seen at once — and it was a very cold winter — was 12 pairs. That was like for a day, and then they were gone.”</p><p class="paragraph">Suzukovich said that the decline of these two ducks appearing on the Lakefill could be due to a number of factors such as changed flight patterns or the weather being too warm for an arctic duck. But he’s noticed another pattern in a different species.</p><p class="paragraph">The common merganser is a duck which Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s All About Birds guide has an entry for: females have “rich, cinnamon heads with a short crest,” while males have “clean white bodies, dark green heads, and a slender, serrated red bill.”</p><figure class="image"><img src="/cook-county-birds/static/Lakefill-02227-1a2c803e53fc42fa8e016ed496b0b206.jpg" alt="A common merganser swims on Northwestern&#x27;s Lakefill."/><figcaption class="image-caption">A common merganser swims on Northwestern&#x27;s Lakefill at sundown on Feb. 26, 2026. (Photo by Valerie Chu)</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">“I don&#x27;t know exactly what prompted it, but you see more of these common mergansers than you used to and it does also seem to coincide with warmer and unpredictable winters,” Suzukovich said.</p><p class="paragraph">On a warm February evening, Weinberg fourth-year Alex Boyko stood on a small hill at the curve of Northwestern’s Lakefill, a pair of binoculars held to his eyes.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/cook-county-birds/static/Lakefill-01989-5ee9f212f24afe14eacb6f91676530c3.jpg" alt="A man with a pair of binoculars looks out across the lake."/><figcaption class="image-caption">Alex Boyle peers through a pair of binoculars toward Nortwestern&#x27;s Lakefill on Feb. 18, 2026. (Photo by Valerie Chu)</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">“We have some migratory ducks on the lagoon right now,” Boyko said. “So I&#x27;m going out to take a look at those.”</p><p class="paragraph">In the span of 45 minutes, Boyko counted 63 individual birds and 19 species. Among them were 10 Canada Geese, 6 Hooded Mergansers, 1 Common Merganser, 2 Buffleheads and 5 Red-winged Blackbirds.</p><p class="paragraph">“There&#x27;s a lot of biodiversity,” Boyko said. “It (birdwatching) is a good way to recharge after a busy day — go out, spend some time around nature.”</p><p class="paragraph">That’s exactly what Weinberg third-year Zach Wolk does too.</p><p class="paragraph">Wolk likes Canada geese. On Northwestern’s version of the social media app Fizz, he’s become known as the “Goose Whisperer.” He even has a stuffed Canada goose sitting in his living room — a mini-model of the real thing that Wolk admits might not be the most true-to-life, yet still shows the cheek patches that he uses alongside other features like a goose’s number of offspring to distinguish Evanston’s Canada geese.</p><p class="paragraph">In the fall and spring when the geese are around, he visits them once a day, a few times a week at Evanston’s Arrington Lagoon and around Northwestern’s Lakefill. And despite recent construction, he said that over the past three years, he hasn’t observed any significant difference in the numbers of Canada geese.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/cook-county-birds/static/cangoo_averages_per_year-1e64b1eb500abf80e7635edcaf6824cc.jpg" alt="A line chart with a minimal theme shows a mostly horizontal line."/><figcaption class="image-caption">Graphic by Valerie Chu</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">“I feel like I know them so well,” Wolk said. “I’m looking forward to seeing which geese nest around the mini lake this year.”</p><h3 class="h3">Methodology</h3><p class="paragraph">Most of the data in this article was from eBird API 2.0.</p><p class="paragraph">I scraped the data using Python and analyzed it using Python or R.</p><p class="paragraph">The data for bird hotspots of Cook County was gathered through using eBird&#x27;s API to collect the location names and coordinates of every bird activity logged.</p><p class="paragraph">The data for Canada geese was gathered through using eBird&#x27;s API to collect Canada geese numbers for every single day in Cook County, from 2020 to now (Feb. 23, 2026).</p></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/home/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
