Naturally, this led to the establishment of data silos, where knowledge between facility managers, AETC leadership, and other stakeholders wasn’t centralized. To solve this issue, NASA’s AETC’s Data &amp; Analytics team built ADAPT, a centralized internal NASA platform for wind tunnel data.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>My project: </i>My wind tunnel test tracking project is a landing page within ADAPT. Previously, we had specific pages to display weekly reports, media, issues and highlights, and even facility-specific data. But facility managers and AETC leadership wanted a way to centralize and showcase data at the individual test level. So I designed, wireframed, then coded that landing page.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Process: </i>My goal for this project was to create a product that would be useful and valuable to facility managers, center integration managers, AETC leadership, and AETC’s Data &amp; Analytics team (us). So with my mentor’s enthusiastic words encouraging me to make this project my own, I jumped onto it.</p><p class="paragraph">My mentor, Rachael Smith, had already crafted a project plan describing all the things we wanted out of this project. So I continued with the next most logical step — user interviews with facility managers and AETC leadership. Through it, I gained two valuable insights I hadn’t previously considered based on the project’s technical requirements: both user groups wanted the page to have as many data visualizations as reasonably possible, and to be easily skimmable for specific test details.</p><p class="paragraph">To achieve this, I made several intentional design choices during the wireframing process done in Figma — I utilized a solid grid that would keep cards clean both vertically and horizontally. I made use of icons and color, where a red dot might mean the test wasn’t timely, or a sun icon would let a user easily locate the test duration card. I organized the modal into rough horizontal sections, where each section would be easily identifiable as Header, Details, Hours, Revenue, and Consumables. Within each of those sections, I grouped smaller cards into neat rows, some showcasing different types of revenue and consumables, each with the dollar amount in a larger font size and bold text to make that data point stand out. Overall, I kept the design minimalistic with pops of intentional color.</p><p class="paragraph">Throughout the development process, I learned how to write code that would reflect our existing platform in terms of design, documentation, file organization, and code structure. I made intentional data visualizations choices, like creating a card that showcased the delta between the consumables a facility manager asked for and what AETC budgeted for them, serving as a quick, visual way to flag any major differences. I queried data from an internal dataset with over two hundred variables using SQL. I utilized complex callbacks in Python to display different data visualizations and section layouts based on whether certain test conditions were met. I created data visualizations using creative ways to circumvent the design limitations of Dash Plotly like invisible colors and adjusted margins. I learned to confidently navigate and contribute to the team’s CI/CD pipeline setup in GitLab. And I kept my documentation clean.</p><p class="paragraph">This project taught me how to navigate the uncertainty and decision making process behind the creation of a new product, one still meant to fit into a preexisting application infrastructure deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I learned how to scan through documentation, Google search results, Stack Overflow, and generative AI to find the tips I needed to debug my code. I got used to delivering biweekly updates and learning from my amazing teammates. And I became familiar with tools used in full stack development and data science, combining those skills with my journalism and design background to create a useful and valuable product.</p><p class="paragraph">[Project, Pt. 2 — P.S. So, actually, the landing page came second. First, came the modal. (I adapted the landing page from the modal after we pushed it to production.)</p><p class="paragraph">In resume form, this is how I would describe the work I did for the modal: Designed, wireframed, and coded a home page modal that displays dozens of data visualizations and product design features to streamline the workflow of AETC leadership and facility managers.</p><p class="paragraph">In practice, this is how it works: The test tracking modal resides on the home page, which prominently features a calendar that indicates the various statuses of all wind tunnel tests for that month. When someone clicks on a specific test on the calendar, the modal opens and displays wind tunnel test information pulled from that specific test uid and year.</p><p class="paragraph">The modal consists of dozens of data visualizations and product design features designed to streamline the workflow of AETC leadership and facility managers. Essentially, the test tracking modal serves as an easily accessible way for any user (a facility member, center integration manager, AETC leader, or D&amp;A team member) to find the information they seek on any individual wind tunnel test.]</p><img style="max-width:100%;margin:1rem 0" src="/cook-county-birds/static/aetchome-03be473734509485f86be7ece1b4a52d.png" alt="NASA Aerosciences Evaluation and Test Capabilities Portfolio Office home page"/></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-content"><p><span class="heart">♥</span> Design and development by Valerie Chu using Gatsby &amp; React</p><p>© <!-- -->2026<!-- --> Valerie Chu</p></div></footer></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/work/nasa-wind-tunnel-test-tracking/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
