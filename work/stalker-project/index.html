It was a six part series consisting of over 5,000 words per part, so it was critical to keep readers engaged. With this in mind, and with the full creative control my mentor gave me over the project, I began designing and coding it. In particular, I focused on making two components.</p><p class="paragraph">The first was animating text messages. Text messages between the two main characters in the story were central to the storytelling process of this investigative piece, so I wanted to showcase the text messages somehow in each part of the series. I started by texting back and forth with my mentor, then studied how the text messages were sent and appeared. (One interesting thing I never noticed before was that when one person sends multiple texts, only the last text bubble gets an attribution arrow.) After looking through numerous photos on Google for additional text message bubble inspiration, I started designing a layout in InDesign then moved it to Figma when I decided I wanted to animate the text messages. After setting up the project within the Chronicle dev rig and getting the story working with ArchieML, I applied the typefaces, font colors and subtle gray-to-black background gradient to the project. Then I began animating the text messages using GSAP. It took a lot of YouTube videos, Googling, trial and error, and talking out my process with my mentor — but I overcame the learning curve and put together the animations! Along the way, I also learned how to use Illustrator to make SVGs work for the text bubble attributions and dove into dozens of niche Stack Overflow posts about animating using GSAP with React.</p><p class="paragraph">The second main element of the investigative project I focused on was a way to keep readers engaged with the article. When I first read a draft of the series in March, it was more than 30,000 words and took me 1 hour 45 minutes to finish reading from start to finish without breaks. While that was because I had the time to read it as part of working on its design/development, I knew most people wouldn’t finish reading the series in one continuous sitting. I needed to figure out how readers would engage with the series, then incorporate both storytelling features and product design to keep them hooked on the story. I started by developing user personas with our audience in mind, which comes from a wide range of backgrounds and with different daily reading habits. The most viable idea emerged as a bookmark modal — when the reader closes the tab or the app, their progress will be automatically saved. No matter which device they continue reading on, the page will resume from where they left off and a bookmark modal will appear, offering a brief summary of the story so far. I designed the bookmark modal and the user flow diagram for it using Figma. I pulled the data for the bookmark modal (ex. Summary hed and summary text applicable to each 25% of the story) from Google Sheets using ArchieML. I played around with different ways of using autosave — first, I tried calculating the scroll percentage and anchoring the bookmark modal to certain percentages. Then my mentor and I decided to make it more flexible, so we changed up our React hooks and used BlueConic to create the autosave feature.</p><p class="paragraph">I also prioritized both product design and accessibility when creating the bookmark modal. The Continue Reading button on the left side of the modal closes the bookmark modal and allows readers to pick up where they left off. The Start Over button on the right side of the modal deletes the bookmark/autosave progress and starts the reader back at the top of the story (which is useful if more than one person shares the same San Francisco Chronicle account). It’s also possible for the reader to close the modal through clicking on the Continue Reading button, the X button, Escape key or anywhere outside of the modal itself. All San Francisco Chronicle products are also coded with mobile-first design, all HTML tags are semantic, and all color contrast and font sizes are chosen to be easily understood whether the reader is using a screen reader or has color blindness.</p><p class="paragraph">By the end of my internship, I had used far more useStates, useEffects, useRefs and useContexts than I ever anticipated. Through working on this project from conception to execution, I gained a deep understanding of user design, product design and web design/development, allowing me to help bring this investigative series to life.</p><button class="view-this-project" style="margin-right:1rem">This investigative story will be published later in 2025</button><img style="max-width:100%;margin:1rem 0" src="/cook-county-birds/static/sfchroniclehome-c69933b1a88b2bebdc6fa0cbf7106092.png" alt="San Francisco Chronicle home page"/></div><footer class="footer"><div class="horizontal-line"></div><div class="footer-content"><p><span class="heart">♥</span> Design and development by Valerie Chu using Gatsby &amp; React</p><p>© <!-- -->2026<!-- --> Valerie Chu</p></div></footer></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/work/stalker-project/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
